## Simulation on network 
This code simulated the spread and circulation of one, two, or three pathogens on a network structure using the SIR compartmental model.  
The main parameters of the model are:
| Parameter       |        Description       | values          | 
|-----------------|:-------------------------|:---------------:|
|$$N$$            | Number of nodes          | $10^4$      |
|$$\mu_1$$, $$\mu_2$$, $$\mu_3$$        |Recovery rate for the first, second and third strain            |  $$\mu_1 = \frac{1}{7(days)}$$,  $$\mu_2=\frac{\mu_1}{\tau_2}$$, $$\mu_3=\frac{\mu_1}{\tau_3}$$    | 
|$$\beta_1$$, $$\beta_2$$, $$\beta_3$$       |Transmission rate for the first, second and third strain       |  $$\beta_1=0.0185$$, $$\beta_2=r_2 \beta_1$$, $$\beta_3=r_3 \beta_1$$     | 
|$$\tau_2$$, $$\tau_3$$        |Scaling factor of the recovery rate of the second and third strain with respect to the first strain |  $$\tau_2=1$$, $$\tau_3=1$$     | 
|$$r_2$$, $$r_3$$     |Ratio of transmission rate of the second and third strain with respect to the first strain|    |
|$$\sigma_2$$      |Cross-immunity between the second variant and the first variant ($\sigma_2=0$ full cross-immunity, $\sigma_2=1$ no cross-immunity)|  $$[0,1]$$  |
|$$\sigma_3$$      |Cross-immunity between the third variant and the first and second variants ($\sigma_3=0$ full cross-immunity, $\sigma_3=1$ no cross-immunity)|  $$[0,1]$$  |
|$$R_1(t_2)$$      |Immunity level of the first variant (cumulative number of the infected) when the second variant is introduced into the population |  $$[0,1]$$  |
|$$\delta t$$      |Time of the emergence of the third variant since the emergence of the second variant in days | $$\ge0$$ |



### How to use
To run the executable, you need:

*	A configuration file specifying the model parameters,
*	A CSV edge list file describing the network,
*	A label that will be used to name the output files

 On Linux, you can execute the program as follows:
 
`./MultiStrainSIRonNet.exe $path_to_configuration_file $path_to_network_edgelist_file $OutputFileLabel`

### ðŸ§© Configuration file

Below is an example of a configuration file (`ModelConfig_2strains.txt`) used to set the model parameters.

```txt
beta1   0.0175
mu1     0.143
tau2    1
tau3    1
r2      1.5 1.6 0.25
r3      1
sigma2  0.05
sigma3  0 0.1 0.2
R1t2    0.1 0.11 0.1
deltat  0 1 3
Iinit   50 50 0
itr     100
```

The meaning of each parameter is explained in the following table:


| **Parameter** | **Example value(s)** | **Description** |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| `beta1` | `0.0175` | Transmission rate of the first variant. |
| `mu1` | `0.143` | Recovery rate (inverse of the infectious period) for the first variant. |
| `tau2`, `tau3` | `1`, `1` | Scaling factors of the recovery rate for variants 2 and 3, relative to the baseline variant. |
| `r2` | `1.5 1.6 0.25` | Range of values for parameter $$r_2$$ (start = 1.5, end = 1.6, step = 0.25). |
| `r3` | `1` | Fixed value of parameter $$r_3$$. |
| `sigma2` | `0.05` | cross immunity of the second variant  $$\sigma_2$$. |
| `sigma3` | `0 0.1 0.2` | cross immunity of the third variant $$\sigma_3$$ (start = 0, end = 0.1, step = 0.2). |
| `R1t2` | `0.1 0.11 0.1` | Range of values for parameter $$R_1(t_2)$$ |
| `deltat` | `0 1 3` | Range of time delays (start = 0, end = 1, step = 3). |
| `Iinit` | `50 50 0` | Initial number of infected individuals for the first, second, and third variants, respectively. |
| `itr` | `100` | Number of stochastic iterations to perform. |

**ðŸ’¡ Notes:**

* Parameters with three numbers (like r2, sigma3, R1t2, deltat) represent vectors:
[start, end, step]. The program iterates through all values in that range.

* This example of a configuration file is designed for a 2-strain scenario where there is no third strain. You can modify these parameters to explore different epidemic scenarios.

### ðŸ“Š Model Output: CSV File Structure
The output of each simulation is stored in a **CSV file**, where each row corresponds to one time step for a specific parameter combination (`r2`, `sigma3`, `R1t2`, `deltat`, and `it`).

Below is a sample of the output file:

| r2  | Sigma | R1t2 | deltat | it | t | N_SSS | N_SSI | N_SSR | N_SIS | N_SIR | N_SRS | N_SRI | N_SRR | N_ISS | N_ISR | N_IRS | N_IRR | N_RSS | N_RSI | N_RSR | N_RIS | N_RIR | N_RRS | N_RRI | N_RRR | Inc_SSI | Inc_SIS | Inc_SIR | Inc_SRI |
|------|--------|-------|---------|----|----|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1.25 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9900 | 0 | 0 | 50 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 50 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 50 | 0 | 0 |
| 1.25 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 9881 | 0 | 0 | 58 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 46 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 0 |
| 1.25 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 9846 | 0 | 0 | 71 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 55 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 21 | 0 | 0 |

Where:

* Columns `r2`, `Sigma`, `R1t2`, `deltat` represents $$r_2$$,  $$\sigma_3$$, $$R_1(t_2)$$, and $$\delta t$$, respectively.
* Column `it` indicates the index of the stochastic iteration (ranging from 0 to itr - 1).
* Column `t` represents the time step in the simulation.
* `N_*` columns indicate the population counts for each compartment defined by the infection status with respect to each of the three strains.
* `Inc_*` columns represent the incidence in each corresponding compartment â€” that is, the number of new entries into that compartment during the current time step.



Since the model includes three strains, each individual can be in one of three states for each strain:
* S = Susceptible
* I = Infected
* R = Recovered

Each compartment name follows the pattern: `N_XYZ`. Where:

- X â†’ status with respect to strain 1
- Y â†’ status with respect to strain 2
- Z â†’ status with respect to strain 3

For example, `N_ISR` represents the number of individuals infected with strain 1, susceptible to strain 2, and recovered from strain 3. And `Inc_ISR` represents new individuals entering the `N_ISR` compartment.

**ðŸ’¡ Notes:**

* The total population at each time step is the sum of all `N_*` compartments.
* Depending on the model configuration, not all compartments may be populated if certain strains are absent or transmission is suppressed.
