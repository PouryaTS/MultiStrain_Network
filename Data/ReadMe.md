# Data

The dataset in this repository contains information on the number of non-household contacts in U.S. states during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of non-household contacts was obtained from the **U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS)**, conducted by the *Delphi Research Group at Carnegie Mellon University* in partnership with *Facebook*, as described in [1].  

The file `mean_var_contact_by_state_by_week_23_11_17.csv` reports the **weekly, state-level means and variances** of the number of contacts used in this study.
